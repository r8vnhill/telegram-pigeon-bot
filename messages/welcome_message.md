Welcome to *Telegram Pigeon*! 🐦
To manage your messages, the bot needs to register your chat id and username.
This is a one-time process, and you can revoke the access at any time by typing `/revoke`.
Send `Yes` to proceed or `No` to cancel the registration process (you can always register later by typing `/start`).
